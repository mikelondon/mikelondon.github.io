What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  - By manipulating the padding, borders and margin, the developer has complete control over objects in their web page. It was fairly hard for me to implement the different concepts but I understand the concepts.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  - I learned that it is extremely frustrating when you are just figuring it out.  But just like above positiong of objects seems to be the best way to get the most out of your HTML.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
  - I thought the easiest pieces of design are the colors, fonts, borders. I found the hardest to be tables, and object positioning.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
  - It is much easier to change the styling of elements through stylesheets rather than using the style= command on each individual element.
