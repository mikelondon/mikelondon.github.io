How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
- I feel that this was a great experience overall. It really solidified the basics of HTML for me.  The wireframing experience with a pair was also nice that I was able to explain my design process with another person.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
- Wireframing is a good way to plan out a project before starting to code. I think that it is similar to pseudo-coding out a program. Instead of just coding something out, I feel that the wireframe is a good way to build a great foundation for the website.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
- A good wireframe to us meant something clean, organized and easy to maneuver.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
- Although I did not implement them into this assignment, I learned that semantic elements are used to group pieces of HTML to increase readability. I implemented many semantic elements into my actual website/blog posts.
