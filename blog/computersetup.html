    <p> Hi there! Today I am going to talk a litle about what a computer is and what it does for us. The most basic computer availble is a calculator. Why is this? Well if you look at the root of the word computer - compute - means to calculate. Of course the computer you are reading this on is way more advanced than a basic calculator. We are going to dive into some of the core components to computers and some of the fancy add-ons we can use to enhance our experience on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Core components to all computers are:
        <ul>
          <li>Motherboard</li>
          <li>CPU or Processor</li>
          <li>RAM or Random Access Memory</li>
          <li>Power Supply Unit or PSU</li>
          <li>Hard Drive or Solid State Drive - Storage</li>
        </ul>
      1. The Motherboard - Think of the motherboard as the skeleton and nervous system to the PC. All of the components are connected to it. The motherboard provides the necesary circuitry to keep everything running by transferring power from the PSU to the various components.
      <br><br>2. The CPU or Processor - The CPU is the actual microprocessor for the computer. It is capable of doing massive amounts of calculations in a short amount of time.
      <br><br>3. RAM - The RAM is the actual workspace for the Processor, the tools needed by the processor wait here until they are needed. A limited amount of RAM can hinder a powerful processor. And Vice versa. It is better to have an equal balance in power to get the most out of your machine.
      <br><br>4. Power Supply Unit - Without the PSU the computer would just be a heavy paper weight.  It is responsible for drawing the necessary electricity from the wall to power all of our components.
      <br><br>5. HDD - Or The Hard Disk Drive is used for storage. In order to interact with your Computer you must have a operating system installed on your Disk Drive to run programs and applications.
    </p>
    <p>To Get a better understanding of the layout inside of a computer, I have posted a picture of my personal Tower.

    <p>
      Of Course if you want to be able to interact with your machine you must have the necessary peripherals.
        <br><br>These include:
          <ul>
            <li>Monitor</li>
            <li>Keyboard</li>
            <li>Mouse</li>
            <li>Speakers or Headphones</li>
          </ul>
    </p>
      <img src="../imgs/setup.png" width=50%, height=50%>
      <p>If you want to enhance your experience on your machine, you can buy stand-alone componemts like a GPU or Graphics Processing Unit, a Sound Card, WiFi card. All of these are not neccessary as they come installed directly on your motherboard. However like I said, if you want to enhance your time spent on the computer or if you are big into Gaming or Design, a GPU would be a great investment. It will free up Processing power from the CPU. What is output from the screen will be processed by the video card or GPU.</p>
      <p>I Hope now you have a better understanding of what a computer is and what some of the core components do. Thanks for reading!</p>
