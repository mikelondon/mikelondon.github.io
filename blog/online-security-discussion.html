        Hello Everyone, I read this piece on cloud security. It was posted today, and it covers how Cloud Computing will change Online Security.
<br><br>
        <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/22/why-cloud-computing-will-shake-up-security/">Cloud Computing Will Shake Up Security - TechCrunch</a>
<br><br>
  As we know people are becoming more and more dependent on their smart phones, tablets what have you. Many of these devices interact with “the cloud” or in actually many different server rooms. These servers are secured and encrypted but we have to realize that the encryptions on “the Cloud” are going to become a big target in the coming year for security vendors and hackers alike.
<br><br>
  We are living in a global mobilized world where almost anyone has access to the internet  in some way shape or form. This cloud security is going to push traditional firewall vendors to change their product and possibly even switch to a cloud based security product.
<br><br>
  The fact of the matter is that people like to have access to their files while on the go, However, something we do not forget is this lingering fear of “is someone gaining accessing to our files.” Last year was an attack on Apple’s iCloud in which hackers gained access to celebrities private photo collection creating a big stir in the security of the iCloud.
<br><br>
  Tom Gillis, CEO of Bracket Computing believes that, “We will see a much larger percentage of enterprise workloads moving to the could in 2016 … Solutions that tightly integrate encryption will be the big winners in the year ahead.” I am definitely curious to see what is to come of online security in the coming year.
 <br><br>
  In the future, stronger Cloud Computing Security is going to be a must. Everyday, people are becoming more and more dependent on their mobile devices, as well as storing files from computers onto servers in “the cloud.”
