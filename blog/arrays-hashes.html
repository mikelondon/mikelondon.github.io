        Two of important concepts to get a hold of in Ruby inlcude Arrays and Hashes.  They share some similar characteristics but they are also fairly different. They are both ways to store information like containers inside of your code.  I have preferences to each in different situations but I think that Arrays are a better way to store information and Hashes are a better way to create lists.  An array is a collection of things ordered from first to last through a series of indices.
        <br><br>
        Writing Arrays and Hashes are fairly straight forward.
        <br><br>
        Here are some examples of arrays:
        <br><br>
        <img class="center-img" src="../imgs/simple-arrays.png" alt="Example-arrays" style ="width: 80%; height: 80%;">
        <br><br>
        Arrays are a great way to store information or elements such as strings, integers, floats, or even other arrays. As you can see above, the variables: hairs, eyes and weights are assign values of arrays located inside the square brackets. [ ] Each different element inside the array is seperated by a comma. Note that strings must be wrapped in "" or ''.
        <br><br>
        The Next topic we are going to cover are Hashes. Hashes are similar to Arrays in that they are containers for elements. THey are split into pairs of information. This split creates the Key and the Value. If we were to create a breakfast variable set equal to a new hash it would look some thing like this breakfast = { }. These curly braces signal a new hash. If we wanted to place some elements inside the hash we would asign a key element which is connected to a value element. So if we wanted to create a breakfast menu with food as the key and whether that food is tasty, healthy, or juicy we would set it up like this:
        <br><br>
        <img class="center-img" src="../imgs/simple-hash.png" alt="example-hash">
        <br><br>
         Each of the Keys is assigned a value. Bacon is assigned the value of tasty, Eggs are assigned the value of Tasty, Oatmeal is assigned the value of healthy, and OJ is assigned the value of Juicy
        <br><br>
        Although this post may not be as in depth as my other posts, I think it covers the very basics of Arrays, and Hashes. I think they both have their places in the Ruby language. There are so many things someone can do with Arrays and Hashes, This blog posts just covers the basic definitions of the objects.
