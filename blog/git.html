  <h2>My First Experience With Git/GitHub</h2>
  <h4>Today's Date: Saturday, January 2, 2016</h4>

      This week has been filled with a wealth of new knowledege for me. I was introduced to the idea of version control, what it does and the role it plays in the development world. If you are like me, you do not have that much experience in coding outside of Ruby, and you are probably very curious to learn as much as you can in the short amount of time.

        This week in phase-0 was all about managing version control through Git/GitHub. Version control can benefit not only a single developer, but a whole team of hundreds, if not thousands of developers. Through VC, team members can: track there changes over time, compare past bits of code with new additions, send the changes for review to the working development team, and give the feeling of complete control over a project.

        This week we focused on git and its relation to the cloud type file system GitHub. The one thing I had to wrap my head around was that git is not the same thing as GitHub. They work in symbiosis.  Git is a program locally installed on your home computer that can track changes to files you create through a system of checkpoints call commits. Git is a powerful tool used through your computers command line.
