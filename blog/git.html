  <h2>My First Experience With Git/GitHub</h2>
  <h4>Today's Date: Saturday, January 2, 2016</h4>

      This week has been filled with a wealth of new knowledge for me. I was introduced to the idea of version control, what it does and the role it plays in the development world. If you are like me, you do not have that much experience in coding outside of Ruby, and you are probably very curious to learn as much as you can in the short amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This week in phase-0 was all about managing version control through Git/GitHub. Version control can benefit not only a single developer, but a whole team of hundreds, if not thousands of developers. Through VC, team members can: track there changes over time, compare past bits of code with new additions, send the changes for review to the working development team, and give the feeling of complete control over a project.

        This week we focused on git and its relation to the cloud type file system GitHub. The one thing I had to wrap my head around was that git is not the same thing as GitHub. They work in symbiosis as opposed to against one another.  Git is a program locally installed on your home computer that can track changes to files you create through a system of checkpoints call commits. GitHub on the other hand, is a powerful tool used to share open-source code through the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I said before, Git is able to track the changes to a tracked file. Before you can track the changes in Git you must know the path it takes to get there. There are three stages in file development. The working phase, staging phase, and the commit phase. The working phase occurs in the directory you have chosen to create to file. This is also called the working directory. To check you're working directory type: pwd in the command line prompt. If you are in the correct prompt you can track the changes to a file by typing, git add <filename>. This will stage the file/folder for commit or get it ready to save.  Once you stage it for commit, type git status to make sure the file is ready for commit.  To commit or save the file, type git commit -m "Enter complete yet punctual comment here" <filename>  This will make sure the file is ready to be sent to our remote Master file on GitHub.
    </p>

        GitHub is a great tool to use in development because it allows groups of individuals to work on development from around the world.  It also allows each of these developers to make changes to the product without damaging or breaking the working code.
