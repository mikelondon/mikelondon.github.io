    ABOUT ME:
    <br><br>
    <p>

    Hey Guys!
    <br><br>
    My name is Michael London, but you can call me Mike. I was born and raised in the heart of the Silicon Valley.  I like to think of my self as an open minded person who is very passionate about the environment. I have a B.A in Environmental Studies from UC Santa Barbara. Yes, I survived 4 years in Isla Vista. I was on the UCSB Men's Swim Team for two years before I decided to focus more on my education.
    <br><br>
    I play multiple instruments and like all different styles of music. I enjoy playing Golf, exercising and I love to eat.<br><br>
    I got into development through my love of computers. Through computers I was able to express my creative side by designing and building desktop layouts for my friends and researching the newest technologies available to the public or in development.
    <br><br>
    I am an avid lurker on TwitchTV. I rarely interact with TwitchChat. I prefer to just sit back and watch some of my favorite streamers. Growing up I was introduced to Super Mario on NES. I have some of my greatest memories growing up trying to beat the original Mario in under 10 minutes. Because of my love for Super Mario Brothers, My go to Twitch Stream is Witwix.
    <br><br>
    I am also very interested eSports. I think this is a growing field and I love to watch competitive players compete with one another. My Favorite eSports to watch include Dota 2 ( [A]LLIANCE ) and CSGO (I am terrible @ CounterStrike)
    <br><br>
    By attending DevBootcamp, I am pursuing my dream of being a developer at TwitchTV in San Francisco. Feel free to join me in my journey to becoming a true certified beginner.
    <br><br>
    P.S. One random thing about me is, I have been in a coma before. (Long Story for another time)
